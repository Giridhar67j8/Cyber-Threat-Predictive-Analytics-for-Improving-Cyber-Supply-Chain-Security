This project, Cyber Threat Predictive Analytics for Cyber Supply Chain Security, enhances CSC security by integrating Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict cyber threats. Using known attack indicators like Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP), and Indicators of Compromise (IoC), ML algorithms analyze data to predict potential threats, achieving 85% accuracy. Modules for different user roles (Service Providers, Admins, Remote Users) streamline functionality, including threat prediction and visualization. Future enhancements aim to incorporate real-time data, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring robust and adaptable cybersecurity.
